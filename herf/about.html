            <p class="lead">Compared with the average wealthy nation, America spends nearly twice as much of its national wealth on health care, about a quarter of which is wasted on inefficient care, unnecessary treatments, and administrative chicanery. The U.S. gets little bang for its exorbitant buck. It has the lowest life-expectancy rate of comparable countries, the highest rates of chronic disease, and the fewest doctors per person. This profit-driven system has scant incentive to invest in spare beds, stockpiled supplies, peacetime drills, and layered contingency plans—the essence of pandemic preparedness. America’s hospitals have been pruned and stretched by market forces to run close to full capacity, with little ability to adapt in a crisis.</p>

            <h1 class="featurette-heading">The electronic healthcare card</h1> <span class="text-muted">A advanced way to change status quo</span>
            <p class="lead">Reliable, secure, efficient, and connected healthcare IT systems are essential for reducing costs by cutting the hefty administration bills usually associated with public healthcare programs.They are also vital in preventing fraud - one of the biggest problems in balancing social security budgets.The deployment of smart health cards and eHealthcare IT systems streamline the prescription process, improves the quality of care given, and simplifies electronic healthcare records management through a coordinated health service process.By identifying the holder and his/her affiliation to an organization and verifying his/her rights, a smart card acts as an essential component of the IT system to create and secure the transmission of standardized medical expense claims.

                Also,dematerialization of the medical prescription from paper to electronic format helps organizations reduce costs and increase efficiency.</p>

            <h1 class="featurette-heading">Privacy </h1><span class="text-muted">Customers' privacy and security are paramount</span>
            <p class="lead"> E-health cards have the potential to improve the patient experience by storing key medical data and medication history, and by serving as an electronic prescription. These cards can also be used to securely store social security numbers.Given the sensitive nature of medical data stored on e-health cards, they must offer robust protection of privacy. Widespread adoption also calls for ease of administration and – most importantly – a mature telematics infrastructure to network all players in the care continuum and enable dynamic updates of data and functionality. With the gradual improvement of the information system, we firmly believe that such medical insurance cards will become more and more popular in the near future and will be as safe as using bank cards.</p>
